=> A component is made up of three things : 1. data (1. props 2. state)  2. logic  3. Appearance 

PROPS 
=> props is the data coming from the outside, and can only be updated by the parent component
=> Props are immutable, that they are READ-ONLY
why immutable ?
=> mutating props objects would affect the parent component creating side effects (not pure) , when u copy an object and mutate the copy the original object will also be mutated
=> if you change an object that is located outside the component function, that function has then created a so called side effect.
=> Side effect happens whenever you change some data thats located outside of the current function.
=> react is all about pure function (no side effects)


=> to define props, we do it in two steps 
1. we pass the props into the component
2. we receive the props in the component we want to pass them into

STATE
=> internal data that can be updated by the component logic.

DATA FLOW: => one way => from parent to child

RENDERING LISTS: when we have an array and we want to create one component for each element of the array
